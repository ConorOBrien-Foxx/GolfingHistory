# Golfing History

Using repository data to procure historical information via commit data. Most languages here are golfing languages (e.g. Jelly, Vyxal, and 05AB1E), or otherwise used often in golfing (e.g. J).

## Caveats

Could not account for the following languages:

- CJam, which uses a [Mercurial repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/cjam/code/ci/default/tree/)
- GolfScript (GitHub repository condensed [in a single year](https://github.com/darrenks/golfscript)), despite being very old
- FlogScript, which does not seem to have a repository
- The following languages, whose repositories are now private/deleted: 
  - [Fuzzy Octo Guacamole](https://github.com/RikerW/Fuzzy-Octo-Guacamole)
  - [Gulf](https://github.engineering.zhaw.ch/munt/Gulf)
  - [JAEL](https://github.com/eduardoHoefel/JAEL)
